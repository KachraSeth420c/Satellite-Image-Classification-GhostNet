#How to run the code

1. Download the dataset "GNR" folder given in .zip file and upload it on your iitb drive.

2. Install the required packages.

3. Upload the python notebook in any IDE capable of running python notebook, preferably, Google Collab.

4. Make sure dataset directory is correct (for you) before running.

5. We have given the code which generated the augmented train image folder(called 'train_new') from train data and 
the one which separates a validation image folder (called 'val') for original train folder. You can skip that part to save time 
and GPU resource and directly go on to run the model using the data we gave in GNR folder. 

(We have added comments in notebook as a guide)
